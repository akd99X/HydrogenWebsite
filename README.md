## Project Overview
I developed the Hydrogen Fuel Cell Calculator to:
- Estimate hydrogen-to-power conversions for various applications.
- Determine hydrogen requirements for specific tasks like vehicle charging.
- Compare CO₂ emissions and costs between Green, Gray, and Blue Hydrogen.

This tool is designed to help researchers, businesses, and engineers make data-driven decisions in the hydrogen fuel industry. The calculator provides real-time, scientifically-backed estimations to promote clean energy adoption.
